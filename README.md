Console based game for practicing what I've learned

Plan: Create an adventure experience with an inventory, currency, vendors, battles, and story with multiple endings. 
Ideally, many of the games items will be stored using csv files. This will give me practice manipulating csv files which I use
heavily in my current career as a biotech research associate.

Game Outline: This game will be a fantasy based adventure game with enemies that will get progressively more difficult as you move
through the main story line. There will be side missions to acquire gear and vendors that will sell gear, single use items such as potions or bombs, 
and tools such as keys for lockboxes you find along the way.

Steps:
1. Create a character using different class presets. (Class, inheritance, and polymorphism practice)
2. Use various libraries to manipulate numbers and csvs (Pandas and numpy are some examples, will make me more comfortable implementing libraries)
3. 




Learn how to add libraries to your projects that others can use when they run your code. Does a virtual environment need to be activated from your main.py?
